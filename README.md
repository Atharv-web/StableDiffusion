TEXT-TO-IMAGE GENERATION: 

This repository contains a Python program that generates images from text prompts using the StableDiffusion model. The goal is to create visually appealing images based on user-provided text descriptions.
I performed this on google colab since i have no gpu, but feel free to use it on ur systems.
